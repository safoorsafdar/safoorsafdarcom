I have been working in IT for over 10 years. I have had the chance to work with a variety of technologies and companies. I have worked as a developer, a tester, an architect, and a technical lead.

I have seen many different ways of doing things and have learned about the pros and cons of each approach.

When I started my career as a software developer, it was obvious that DevOps was not even on the horizon. It was just not something people talked about at all. It wasn't until later that I realized how important it is for companies to adopt DevOps practices if they want to be successful in this new world of technology.

## So why did I choose DevOps as my career path?

Here are five reasons why:

### 1. It's challenging

DevOps is not about fixing bugs and adding features to your product. It's not about automating your infrastructure, deploying software, and testing it before you release it to production. It's also about improving your development process, and finding ways to make it better, faster, and more efficient.

### 2. The culture of DevOps is very collaborative.

This is one of my favorite aspects of the DevOps community. I have never seen such a tight-knit group of people who are willing to help each other improve their skills and grow as professionals. It's not uncommon for me to reach out to someone on Twitter or Slack with a question about something we're working on, and they'll respond immediately with an answer that helps me solve my problem. With DevOps, [60% less time](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/devops-statistics) is spent handling support cases. I also love how open people are about sharing their knowledge and experiences — whether it's in an article or blog post or in person at a conference or meetup event.

### 3. There are many opportunities for personal growth in this field.

Another reason why I like being a DevOps engineer is that there's always room for improvement — whether it's learning new technologies or improving your systems administration skills, there are always new things to learn! And because DevOps requires so many different skill sets, you can always find something new to learn even if you're already experienced in another

### 4. High Demand for DevOps Professionals

The demand for DevOps professionals has never been higher. According to a [study](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2017/9/devops-jobs-6-eye-opening-statistics), DevOps engineer ranks #2 on Glassdoor’s 50 Best Jobs in America rankings. This is an impressive growth rate considering the relatively short time frame of just 6 years. 60 percent of hiring managers are looking to fill DevOps engineer positions, according to the 2017 Open Source Jobs Report, a study conducted by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and tech jobs site [Dice](https://www.dice.com/).

#### 5. The Opportunity To Work With Many Technologies

As a DevOps professional, you will not be limited to just one technology or platform but will be able to work on multiple technologies at once. This allows you to develop your skill set while working with different technologies and gaining experience in areas that may not have been exposed before such as cloud computing or data analytics.


I highly recommend taking a close look at DevOps and considering it as an area of development to pursue. It is still a relatively new field, but the career opportunities are great and it has the potential to be around for years to come. I hope that this article provided some information and encouragement on the subject and will help you on your journey to learn more about DevOps.
