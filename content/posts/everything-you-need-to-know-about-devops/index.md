## What is DevOps?

The DevOps definition has evolved over time, but the original concept remains the same.

> *"It is an approach that emphasizes communication and collaboration between developers and IT operations teams to improve the flow of information between them, as well as their ability to deliver applications."*

DevOps is a way of thinking about IT that helps you deliver value to your customers faster. It allows you to get code from your developers into production. and it also helps you understand how your infrastructure is performing.

The term “DevOps” was first coined by Patrick Debois in 2009. The name DevOps is a compound word for development and operations. The project aims to bring together the software development side (developers) and the IT operations side (IT Ops) to work together in a more collaborative way.

## Traditional Application Release Process

Before DevOps became popular, many companies had a very **traditional application release process** where all changes were handled by one team – typically an IT Operations team – which worked independently of other teams such as Development or QA teams. This often led to conflicts, misunderstandings, delays, or even failures when moving code from Development into Production environments due to a lack of communication or miscommunication between teams with different priorities and goals.
