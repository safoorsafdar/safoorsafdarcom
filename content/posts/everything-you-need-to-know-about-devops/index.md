## What is DevOps?

The DevOps definition has evolved over time, but the original concept remains the same.

> *"It is an approach that emphasizes communication and collaboration between developers and IT operations teams to improve the flow of information between them, as well as their ability to deliver applications."*

DevOps is a way of thinking about IT that helps you deliver value to your customers faster. It allows you to get code from your developers into production. and it also helps you understand how your infrastructure is performing.

The term “DevOps” was first coined by Patrick Debois in 2009. The name DevOps is a compound word for development and operations. The project aims to bring together the software development side (developers) and the IT operations side (IT Ops) to work together in a more collaborative way.

## Traditional Application Release Process

Before DevOps became popular, many companies had a very **traditional application release process** where all changes were handled by one team – typically an IT Operations team – which worked independently of other teams such as Development or QA teams. This often led to conflicts, misunderstandings, delays, or even failures when moving code from Development into Production environments due to a lack of communication or miscommunication between teams with different priorities and goals.



## Challenges DevOps tries to solve

You will learn some of the most difficult problems that DevOps has attempted to solve.



**The gap between development and operations teams**

It’s very common to see developers and operations people working. Developers create new features while the operations team deploys them on production environments. Each team works independently, without considering the other team's needs. This leads to increased complexity in software development processes and reduces productivity levels.

\
**A lack of coordination between teams**

Coordination between teams is essential for any business process. If you want your business process to run smoothly, then you need good coordination between various departments within your organization. However, it’s not possible for each department to coordinate with each other directly; instead, a mediator needs to take care of this process for both parties involved in the project.



**Improving quality**

When developers can work directly with their operations team, it becomes easier for them to identify bugs in their code before they reach production. This also makes it easier for them to fix those bugs once they are identified — again before they reach production.

**Increasing visibility into production**

When developers have access to real-time data about what's happening in production, they can make better decisions about what needs fixing or improving. This ensures that changes made in production do not negatively impact customers' experience with the product or service being delivered.

**Increases Speed**

Developers want to get their products out, but they can't do that if they're waiting on manual testing or deployments that take days. DevOps speeds up these processes by automating them.
