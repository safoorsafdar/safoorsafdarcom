If you're new to the world of IT infrastructure, you may have heard the term "Infrastructure as Code" or "IAC" tossed around, but may not know exactly what it means. Essentially, IAC is an approach to managing IT infrastructure through the use of code. It's an important concept in modern IT infrastructure as it provides faster and more efficient infrastructure deployment, improved scalability, and better infrastructure management, among other benefits.

In this blog post, we'll dive deeper into IAC, explore its key features and capabilities, and take a closer look at one of the most popular IAC tools - Terraform.

## DefiningÂ IAC

Infrastructure as Code (IAC) is an approach to managing IT infrastructure through the use of code. Essentially, it involves writing code that defines and automates the deployment and management of infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, databases, and networks.

### Why IAC is important in modern IT infrastructure

IAC provides numerous benefits, including faster and more efficient infrastructure deployment, improved scalability, and better infrastructure management. It also promotes consistency and eliminates manual errors, which can be costly and time-consuming to fix. Additionally, IAC makes it easier to track changes to infrastructure and to roll back changes if necessary.

### Key features and capabilities of each tool

There are many IAC tools available, including Terraform, Ansible, and Chef. Each tool has its own unique features and capabilities.

| IAC Tool | Main Focus | Capabilities | Supported Providers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Terraform | Infrastructure Provisioning | Declarative Syntax, Resource Graph, Dependency Management | AWS, Azure, GCP, and more |
| Ansible | Configuration Management and Automation | Agentless, Idempotent, Easy-to-learn language | AWS, Azure, GCP, and more |
| Chef | System-level Configuration and Policy Management | Recipe-based Configuration, Easy integration with Cloud platforms | AWS, Azure, GCP, and more |

### Declarative and Imperative Approaches in Terraform

Terraform uses a declarative approach to infrastructure management, meaning that the code describes the desired state of the infrastructure, and Terraform is responsible for creating and maintaining that state. In contrast, an imperative approach involves specifying the exact steps needed to achieve the desired state. Declarative approaches are generally more flexible and easier to use, as they allow for easier automation and standardization of infrastructure management.

### Comparison of IAC tools based on their working approach

While all IAC tools automate infrastructure management, they differ in their approach. Some tools use a declarative approach, which focuses on defining the desired state of infrastructure resources, while others use an imperative approach, which involves defining the steps required to achieve the desired state.

| IAC Tool | Approach | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Terraform | Declarative | Defines the desired state of infrastructure resources and lets Terraform handle the details of how to achieve that state |
| Ansible | Declarative | Uses YAML-based configuration files to define the desired state of infrastructure resources |
| Chef | Declarative | Uses recipes to define the desired state of infrastructure resources and applies them to nodes |
| Puppet | Declarative | Uses a declarative language to define the desired state of infrastructure resources and applies changes to nodes |
| SaltStack | Imperative | Uses a domain-specific language to define the steps required to achieve the desired state of infrastructure resources |
| CFEngine | Imperative | Uses a declarative language to define the desired state of infrastructure resources and applies changes to nodes |
| PowerShell DSC | Declarative | Uses PowerShell scripts to define the desired state of infrastructure resources and applies changes to nodes |
| Kubernetes | Declarative | Uses YAML-based configuration files to define the desired state of containers and their infrastructure requirements |

### Distinction between two phases in IAC - Initial setup and maintenance

IAC is typically divided into two phases - initial setup and maintenance. 

**The initial setup** process for Infrastructure as Code (IAC) and Terraform involves writing the code that defines the infrastructure resources and automates their deployment. This step is crucial because it sets the foundation for the entire infrastructure provisioning process. The code defines the desired state of the infrastructure resources, which Terraform will then use to create and manage those resources.

**Maintenance** involves updating the code to reflect changes in the infrastructure over time. In other words, as your infrastructure needs change, you need to modify your IAC code to reflect those changes.

Overall, the maintenance phase in IAC is critical to ensuring that your infrastructure remains up-to-date and meets the changing needs of your business.

Now, let's take a closer look at Terraform.

## Terraform - An Introduction

### What is Terraform

Terraform is an open-source IAC tool. It provides a simple way to define and automate the deployment and management of infrastructure resources across single or multiple providers.

### Understanding infrastructure provisioning

Infrastructure provisioning involves the creation of infrastructure resources like virtual machines, networks, and storage. Terraform simplifies this process by allowing users to define infrastructure resources in a simple and consistent manner.

### Terraform use cases and applications

Terraform can be used in a variety of scenarios, including cloud infrastructure provisioning, on-premises infrastructure provisioning, and multi-cloud deployments. It can also be used for continuous deployment and testing.

| Use Case | Application |
| --- | --- |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform allows for infrastructure provisioning through code, which provides version control and easy collaboration. |
| Cloud Platform Provisioning | Terraform can be used to provision resources on major cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. |
| Multi-Cloud Management | Terraform enables organizations to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and on-premises data centers. |
| DevOps Automation | Terraform can automate infrastructure deployment, which helps to accelerate development cycles and reduce the risk of human error. |
| Continuous Delivery | Terraform can be used as part of a continuous delivery pipeline to automate infrastructure provisioning and deployments. |
| Compliance as Code | Terraform allows for infrastructure to be provisioned with security and compliance policies in mind, providing an auditable trail of changes. |
| Disaster Recovery | Terraform can be used to quickly provision disaster recovery infrastructure in the event of a failure. |
| Immutable Infrastructure | Terraform can be used to create immutable infrastructure, which helps to increase reliability and reduce maintenance overhead. |
| Microservices Deployment | Terraform can be used to deploy microservices-based applications by provisioning the necessary infrastructure resources. |
| Serverless Infrastructure | Terraform can be used to provision serverless infrastructure on cloud platforms, such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. |

## How Terraform Works

Terraform works by defining and managing infrastructure resources through code. This code is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and describes the desired state of the infrastructure.

### Understanding the Architecture and Components

Terraform architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Terraform Core:** This is the core component of Terraform, responsible for parsing the configuration files, building the resource graph, and executing the plan to create, update or delete resources. It interacts with the provider plugins to manage the resources.
2. **Provider Plugins:** Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Each provider has its own plugin that Terraform uses to communicate with the provider APIs to create, update, and delete resources.
3. **State Storage:** Terraform uses state files to keep track of the current state of the resources it manages. The state files are JSON files that store the mapping between the resources in the configuration files and the real resources in the cloud provider.

### Terraform Example Configuration File

Let's take a look at a simple Terraform configuration file that creates an AWS EC2 instance.

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

This configuration file consists of two sections.

1. **Provider Block:** The provider block defines the cloud provider and its configuration. In this example, we're using AWS as our cloud provider, and specifying the region as **"us-west-2"**.
2. **Resource Block:** The resource block defines the AWS instance we want to create, and its configuration. We're specifying the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID as **"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"**, the instance type as **"t2.micro"**, and assigning a tag to the instance with the name **"example-instance"**.

### Terraform Basic Commands

Here are some basic Terraform commands and their usage:

1. **Terraform init** - initializes a new Terraform working directory and downloads any necessary plugins.
2. **Terraform plan** - shows a preview of changes that Terraform will make to the infrastructure.
3. **Terraform apply** - creates, modifies, or deletes resources based on the current Terraform configuration.
4. **Terraform destroy** - destroys all resources created by Terraform.
5. **Terraform state** - provides information about the Terraform state, including which resources are currently managed.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using Terraform Basic Commands

To get started with Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Install Terraform on your local machine.
2. Write your Terraform configuration file in HCL.
3. Initialize your working directory using the **`terraform init`** command.
4. Use the **`terraform plan`** command to preview changes to the infrastructure.
5. Use the **`terraform apply`** command to create, modify, or delete resources.
6. Use the **`terraform destroy`** command to remove all resources created by Terraform.
